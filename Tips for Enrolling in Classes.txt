Run a degree audit to find out what you have already accomplished and what you have left to complete.
Go to mydegreeaudit.unt.edu. Log in with your EUID and Password. On the "Audits" tab, click "Run Declared Program" at the bottom of the page. (You can also choose "Select a Different Program" if you are considering changing your major). A list of audits run will appear. Select "View Audit" next to the audit you just created (check the created column to ensure you're selecting the most current). Any section listed with a red X has courses yet to be taken/passed for graduation. Look here for possible courses to take next! Remember to check to make sure you meet the prerequisites by clicking on the course code in your degree audit.

Determine how many hours you want to take in the upcoming term. Students in good academic standing are permitted to enroll in up to 19 hours in the fall and spring terms and in up to 18 hours in the summer terms. If you are not in good academic standing, consider limiting your enrollment to 12-15 hours per semester until you reach good standing. Fewer hours will allow you more time to focus on each class and return to good academic standing.

Plan the classes you need and are able to take in the upcoming term.

If you need department permission to enroll in a class, you will need to contact or e-mail the department that hosts the class with your student ID number and the classes you want to enroll in. Some classes may require pre-requisites or professor approval as well. Please note that some courses are reserved for individuals only in the college, and permission is not guaranteed.
